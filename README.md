Quick demo from the lightning talk I gave at YAPC::EU 2016

# Abstract

Ever wanted to write a system for processing lots of data but think writing bsub/qsub isn't optimal? Then eHive might be what you need. eHive works with traditional schedulers such as LSF/OpenLava to coordinate processing across compute farms with processing modules written in pure Perl. 

We will quickly show one of these pipelines on a local laptop and some of the additional software we can use.
